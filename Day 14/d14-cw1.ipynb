    "    -  The loop begins with a \"for\" keyword. \"for loop\" requires this\n",
    "    -  There is a new variable used after \"for\" called \"measure\" which will have the value of each item of the list\n",
    "    -  There is a keyword \"in\" after the variable. This is necessary to signify the source of the data (in this case a list)\n",
    "    -  After \"in\", there is the list name (weight_measurements)\n",
    "    -  The statement ends with a semicolon. Everything that is indented below the line is a chunk of code that is looped multiple times\n",
    "    -  All this means is that the computer **sequentially** picks value from the list weight_measurements and assigns that value to the measure variable\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -  Within the loop, each value in the list is added to the sum_weight variable one by one\n",
    "    -  The count_weight variable is increased by 1 each time the loop runs "
